Airport Lookup Program for Distributed Systems Assignment 4

* Places Server -- Jarek
 * This is mostly done, now can do leading matches.
        There is a simple PlacesClient class that shows how to connect and make calls to the
        places server.

* Airport Server -- Yuriy
 * Will finish this tomorrow (Saturday) so we can write and test the client.
        Although it should be possible to write the client assuming this already works
